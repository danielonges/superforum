Additional Features:

1. Added a global search function to search for forums by their title.
2. Added a view count for threads that auto-increments per navigation to the thread page.
3. Added ability to create post with a thread.
4. Added a recent threads segment on the home page that allows you to view the most recent threads that you have created.
5. Add validation for input fields such as email.

There have been two accounts created for the purposes of testing:

Normal user account:
Username = "user"; password = "password"
